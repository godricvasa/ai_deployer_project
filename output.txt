 requirements.txt

ðŸš€ Final Output from Build File Reader:
 Here is the Python code that reads and prints all data present in the 'requirements.txt' file located at the specified path:

```python
file_path = r'C:\Users\vasanth\Desktop\ai_deployer_project\test-repos\fastapi\requirements.txt'

try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
    print(data)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f'Error: The file at {file_path} was not found.')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')
```

This code attempts to open and read the 'requirements.txt' file, then prints its contents. If the file is not found or another error occurs, an appropriate message will be printed.
